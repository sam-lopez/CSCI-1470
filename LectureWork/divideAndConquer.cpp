Description   : Prompts the user for the experiment name, number of results, and the value
of each result. Computes and displays the experiment name, total, and 
average of the results.

Input: name of experiment, # of results, and each lab result

Process: 1) while ( there are lab results to be entered)
get result from user and total the results as they are entered

2) calculate average = total / # of results

Output:name of the result, total, and average (3 decimals places)
